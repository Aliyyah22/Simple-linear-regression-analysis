Instruction: Linear Regression Prediction Task

1. Objective: 
Predict sales based on advertising spend using linear regression.

2. Dataset: 
The dataset contains information on advertising spend, country, state, platform, and sales.

3. Task: 
Build a linear regression model to predict sales (dependent variable) using advertising spend (independent variable).

4. Steps:
   - Load the dataset from 'african_sales_data.csv'.
   - Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a linear regression model using the training data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
